# Bike Sharing Program

The question was raised:  Can a successful Citi Bike Sharing program from New York City be studied and replicated in another US city, for example Demoines, Iowa?  To ascertain the success factors in New York's CitiBike program an analysis of available data was performed.

## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
The anaysis was based on key questions or success factors.  By understanding these success factors and performing a subsequent analysis of Demoine's population, economy and city structure we can answer many of the key questions as to whether a similar program would be success in Demoines.

Key Questions:
* Trip Duration: How long are people ridine?
* Timing: What days and hours of the day are most popular?
* Key Users: Is there a Super User demographic? What is it? Age, gender, location?
* Station Location:  How many pick up an drop of locatins? What is their distribution?
* Maintenance:  Is there a way to maintain such a diverse number of movable objects


## Results: 
Answers to the key questions can be seen in the following visualizations.

### Trip Duration:

## Summary: 
The CitiBike program in New York has a lot going for it.  It is already established with installations focused on the core or Manhatten but very braodly spread through the surrounding suburbs as well.  This provides versitility and well as close availability to the users.  While their rides are not long their subscriber base are faithful making up the core of their business.   

Although Demoines is a very different city there is good reason to research this location for a future CitiBike installation.  
* New York City as of 2022	had a population 18,867,000 with a growth rate of only 0.23%.
* Des Moines as os 2022 had a population of 559,000 but a growth rate of 1.27% over 2021.
So although Des Moines is a much smaller city is is a city with a higher growth rate!  This hold out promise of a growing enterprise!

More detail could be gleaned from this dataset by looking deeper into the following:
* Most highly used start and stop station locations.  With Demoines being a smaller community they will have to start small.  Should they focus on central locations or commuter locations from the suburbs?
*
