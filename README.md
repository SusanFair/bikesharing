# Bike Sharing Program

The question was raised:  Can a successful CitiBike bike sharing program from New York City be studied and replicated in another US city, for example Demoines, Iowa?  To ascertain the success factors in New York's CitiBike program an analysis of available data was performed.

## Overview of the analysis: 
The anaysis was based on key questions or success factors.  By understanding these success factors and performing a subsequent analysis of Demoine's population, economy and city structure we can answer many of the key questions as to whether a similar program would be success in Demoines.

Key Questions:
* Trip Duration: How long are people ride?
* Timing: What days and hours of the day are most popular?
* Key Users: Is there a Super User demographic? What is it? Age, gender, location?
* Station Location:  How many pick up an drop of locations? What is their distribution?
* Maintenance:  Is there a way to maintain such a diverse number of movable objects?


## Results: 
Answers to the key questions can be seen in the following visualizations.

### Trip Duration: 
How long are people riding?  Ride duration can affect profitability.  Rides are less than an hour but the quantity of riders using the program certainly makes up for this.  Also the broad range of ages using the service is a good sign for future revenues.  The Checkout Times by Age and Type visualization shows that riders just keep on riding as they grow a little older.

### Timing: 
What days and hours of the day are most popular?  Hot spots on the heat map charts show that riders are predominantly riding during the rush hour time periods.  There is an especially high rate after work which may account for the exercise enthusiast doing a few kilometres before heading home instead of hitting the gym.  Also the weekend warriors are out getting some fresh air, with Saturdays being another hotspot for usage times.

### Key Users: 
Is there a Super User demographic? The super users are the subscribers.  Having a similar subscriber base will be critical for the success of a future Demoines CitiBike offering.  The Subscriber show hot on the heat map indicating that they are the predominant users during the week.  Once gain the subscribers over 40 are also big users and are keeping on riding!

### Station Location:  
How many pick up an drop of locations? What is their distribution?  We see a high density of pick up and drop off locations being used in the city centre of Manhatten.  There are clusters as well in the suburbs.  Interesting that in the outlying neighbourhoods selecting a start location will usually show a local end location as well.  This would indicate that people are riding close to home and close to work.

### Maintenance:  
Is there a way to maintain such a diverse number of movable objects?  Maintenance is key to keeping the customers happy.  The time of day data will show that there are daily and weekly lower use periods where maintenance can be performed.  The Top 10 Bikes is a valuable addition visualization showing which bikes have logged the most time.  This data will drive an organized and strategic maintenance plan.

## Summary: 
The CitiBike program in New York has a lot going for it.  It is already established with installations focused on the core or Manhatten but very braodly spread through the surrounding suburbs as well.  This provides versitility and well as close availability to the users.  While their rides are not long their subscriber base are faithful making up the core of their business.   

Although Demoines is a very different city there is good reason to research this location for a future CitiBike installation.  
* New York City as of 2022	had a population 18,867,000 with a growth rate of only 0.23%.
* Des Moines as os 2022 had a population of 559,000 but a growth rate of 1.27% over 2021.
So although Des Moines is a much smaller city is is a city with a higher growth rate!  This hold out promise of a growing enterprise!

More detail could be gleaned from this dataset by looking deeper into the following:
* Most highly used start and stop station locations.  With Demoines being a smaller community they will have to start small.  Should they focus on central locations or commuter locations from the suburbs?
* The usage for each bike_id is an additional analysis which will add practical value in building a viable maintenance plan.
